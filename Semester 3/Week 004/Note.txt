My third semester is going on.
This is the fourth week contest of CU Chapter on Codechef.
01 November'21 - 07 November'21

Note: Haven't done binary search yet, so took help from some editorials while solving this week's solutions. :)

Will surely try these questions again, after once going thru the binary search and will surely update the code completly without any palgiarism, sorry for this week :)
